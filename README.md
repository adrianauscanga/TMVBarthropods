# TMVBarthropods
This is the repository for data used in my master's thesis project *"Comparative Phylogeography of high mountain arthropods in the TMVB"*.
This repository contains code for delimiting Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using a Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent method (GMYC), estimate genetic and specific diversity, and run a null model. It also contains the sequences and trees needed to run the code.

## Prerequisites
Software:
* BEAST, BEAUTI and treeanotator
* R libraries *"splits", "ape", "MASS", "paran", "ape", "ade4", "adegenet", "diveRsity", "pegas", "vegan"*

Data:
* Sequences in fasta format
* Ultrametric trees
